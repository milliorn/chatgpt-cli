ChatGPT CLI is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows you to have interactive conversations with OpenAI's GPT-3 powered chatbot, known as ChatGPT. With this CLI tool, you can have natural language conversations with the chatbot and receive text-based responses.

The application is built using Python and leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 API to enable seamless communication with the chatbot. It provides a simple and efficient way to interact with the language model, making it suitable for testing, prototyping, and exploring various use cases.

## Features

- Interactive Chat: Engage in real-time, back-and-forth conversations with ChatGPT.
- Easy-to-Use: Simple and intuitive command-line interface for smooth interactions.
- Customizable Prompts: Tailor your conversation starters and prompts as per your requirements.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
2. To start a conversation with the GPT-3 chatbot, simply type the following command in your terminal in project root:

`npm start`

or

`node chatgpt`

The chatbot will generate a prompt for you to respond to, and it will continue the conversation with you based on your input.

## Configuration
