# OpenAI GPT-3 Chatbot in Go

This is a Go implementation of a chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. The chatbot interacts with users via the command line interface, allowing them to enter prompts and receive responses generated by the GPT-3.5 model.

## Prerequisites

Before running the chatbot, ensure you have Go installed on your system. Additionally, you need to set up an OpenAI API key and store it in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, such as a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

## Instructions

### Build the executable

```bash
go build
```

or you can test try it with this...

```bash
go run .
```

or

```bash
go run main.go types.go
```

if you run the code without building it then skip the next step.

### Run the executable

```bash
./chatgpt-cli.exe
```

Follow the prompts to interact with the chatbot. Enter your prompt when prompted, and the chatbot will generate a response based on the input.

To exit the chatbot, type 'exit' when prompted for input.
